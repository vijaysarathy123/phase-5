Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing is crucial to clean, format, and prepare the data for analysis. The specific preprocessing steps will depend on your data source and the format of the data. Here is a general outline of preprocessing steps:
python
Copy code
# Sample data preprocessing code in Python
import pandas as pd

# Load the raw data
raw_data = pd.read_csv("energy_consumption_data.csv")

# Data cleaning and transformation
# Remove missing values
raw_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Convert date/time columns to datetime objects
raw_data['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(raw_data['timestamp'])

# Aggregating data (e.g., hourly or daily averages)
daily_energy = raw_data.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='timestamp', freq='D'))['energy_consumption'].sum()
Data Collection:
Collecting energy consumption data may involve different methods, such as using smart meters, IoT devices, or sensors. Below is a simplified example of data collection using Python:
python
Copy code
# Sample data collection code using Python
import requests
import json

# Define the API endpoint for data collection
api_url = "https://example.com/api/energy_consumption"

# Make a request to collect the data
response = requests.get(api_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    energy_data = json.loads(response.text)
    # Process the data as needed
else:
    print("Failed to collect data. Status code:", response.status_code)
Visualization:
Visualization is essential for understanding energy consumption patterns. You can use various libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create interactive visualizations. Below is an example using Matplotlib in Python:
python
Copy code
# Sample code for data visualization using Matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a line plot to visualize daily energy consumption
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(daily_energy.index, daily_energy.values)
plt.title("Daily Energy Consumption")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Energy Consumption (kWh)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
This project aims to measure and visualize energy consumption data. It includes data preprocessing, data collection, and visualization components. This README provides instructions on how to run the code and lists the necessary dependencies.

Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

Python (>= 3.6)
Pandas
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Requests (for data collection)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib requests
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vijaysarathy123/energy-consumption-measurement.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd energy-consumption-measurement
Usage
Follow these steps to run the code:

Data Preprocessing
Place your raw energy consumption data in a CSV file named energy_consumption_data.csv in the project directory.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the data preprocessing script:

bash
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
This script will clean and preprocess the data, aggregating it to daily energy consumption.

Data Collection
Modify the data collection script to connect to your data source. You can use the provided requests example in the code.

Run the data collection script:

bash
Copy code
python data_collection.py
This script collects the latest energy consumption data from your source.

Visualization
After running data preprocessing and collection, you can visualize the data by running:
bash
Copy code
python data_visualization.py
This script generates a line plot of daily energy consumption.
